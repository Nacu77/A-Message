# A-Message
A boy wants to send a message (ticket) to his colleague, but the course already started.
The students are placed in benches by two people each. The benches are arranged in several columns. A stundent can only send the message to the colleague in front/back and the colleague in left/right if they are on the same bench. The message can be sent from a column to other column only by the last two rows. Also, there are some stundents who are upset with each other, so the message can't be transfered between them.
The program finds the shortest way for the message to reach the colleague.
